<h2 id="section-platform-overview-services-and-features">Platform Overview: Services and Features</h2>
<p>Folks Finance is a one-stop DeFi powerhouse, providing users with a range of financial tools to manage their digital assets<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Folks Finance is a one-stop DeFi powerhouse,providing users with a range of financial tools to manage their digital assets." id="skTag-1986021569342566408" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021569342566408"></em>. At its core, Folks offers <strong>lending and borrowing</strong> markets where users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow assets by using collateral<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="At its core,Folks offers lending and borrowing markets where users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow assets by using collateral." id="skTag-1986021472240234496" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021472240234496"></em>. This lending mechanism allows users to earn passive income on their crypto holdings while also providing liquidity to the market. For example, depositing ALGO or USDC in Folks’ lending pools yields interest, and users can borrow stablecoins or other assets against collateralized positions.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="For example,depositing ALGO or USDC in Folks’ lending pools yields interest,and users can borrow stablecoins or other assets against collateralized positions." id="skTag-1986021299467022341" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299467022341"></em></p>
<p>One of Folks Finance’s standout features is its <strong>liquid staking service</strong>, which introduces a new way to earn staking rewards on Algorand<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="One of Folks Finance’s standout features is its liquid staking service,which introduces a new way to earn staking rewards on Algorand." id="skTag-1986021392351326218" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021392351326218"></em>. In late 2022, Folks Finance pioneered the concept of <strong>Algo Liquid Governance</strong> by creating the <code>gALGO</code> token – a liquid staking derivative for Algorand’s native ALGO token<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="In late 2022,Folks Finance pioneered the concept of Algo Liquid Governance by creating the gALGO token – a liquid staking derivative for Algorand’s native ALGO token." id="skTag-1986021731681787905" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731681787905"></em>. <code>gALGO</code> represents staked ALGO that can be used as collateral or traded, unlocking liquidity for staked assets<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="gALGO represents staked ALGO that can be used as collateral or traded,unlocking liquidity for staked assets." id="skTag-1986021731862650889" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731862650889"></em>. This innovation has proven extremely popular: as of early 2024, <code>gALGO</code> held a significant portion of the Algorand ecosystem’s TVL, underscoring its impact<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="This innovation has proven extremely popular: as of early 2024,gALGO held a significant portion of the Algorand ecosystem’s TVL,underscoring its impact." id="skTag-1986021569234276352" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021569234276352"></em>. Folks Finance’s liquid staking has since expanded, including <strong>xALGO</strong> – a cross-chain version of Algorand’s staking token that can be used on other networks like Avalanche<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Folks Finance’s liquid staking has since expanded,including xALGO – a cross-chain version of Algorand’s staking token that can be used on other networks like Avalanche." id="skTag-1986021324804939813" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021324804939813"></em>. This cross-chain liquid staking feature allows users to stake ALGO on Algorand and use the resulting xALGO as collateral on another chain<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="This cross-chain liquid staking feature allows users to stake ALGO on Algorand and use the resulting xALGO as collateral on another chain," id="skTag-1986021731855069186" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731855069186"></em>, effectively bringing Algorand’s yield into other DeFi ecosystems.</p>
<p>In addition to lending and staking, Folks Finance offers a <strong>DEX aggregator</strong> and <strong>cross-chain bridge</strong> functionality<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="In addition to lending and staking,Folks Finance offers a DEX aggregator and cross-chain bridge functionality." id="skTag-1986021263752650763" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650763"></em>. The Folks Router is an in-house DEX aggregator that seamlessly routes trades across Algorand’s top decentralized exchanges (DEXes) – Tinyman, Pact, and Humble – to find the best rates for users<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The Folks Router is an in-house DEX aggregator that seamlessly routes trades across Algorand’s top decentralized exchanges (DEXes) – Tinyman,Pact,and Humble – to find the best rates for users." id="skTag-1986021324804939792" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021324804939792"></em>. This aggregator is highly composable and can be used in conjunction with Folks’ lending and staking features<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="This aggregator is highly composable and can be used in conjunction with Folks’ lending and staking features." id="skTag-1986021299471216652" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299471216652"></em>. For example, users can use Folks Router to swap tokens and then immediately deposit the proceeds into a lending pool for yield<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="For example,users can use Folks Router to swap tokens and then immediately deposit the proceeds into a lending pool for yield." id="skTag-1986021731862650888" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731862650888"></em>. The platform also introduced an <strong>Ultraswap feature</strong>, enabling users to use flash loans to increase their exposure to crypto markets, essentially leveraging their collateral in innovative ways.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The platform also introduced an Ultraswap feature,enabling users to use flash loans to increase their exposure to crypto markets,essentially leveraging their collateral in innovative ways." id="skTag-1986021324804939794" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021324804939794"></em></p>
<p>Overall, Folks Finance provides a <strong>comprehensive, user-friendly DeFi experience</strong> across multiple chains. It serves as a hub where users can deposit assets, earn yields, borrow, swap tokens, and manage liquid staking positions – all in one interface<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="It serves as a hub where users can deposit assets,earn yields,borrow,swap tokens,and manage liquid staking positions – all in one interface." id="skTag-1986021731862650890" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731862650890"></em>.

<h2 id="section-recent-developments-and-launches">Recent Developments and Launches</h2>
<p>Folks Finance has been actively expanding its offerings and features, with several notable developments and launches in recent times<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Folks Finance has been actively expanding its offerings and features,with several notable developments and launches in recent times." id="skTag-1986021731862650880" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731862650880"></em>. Here are the key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FOLKS Token Launch (November 2025):</strong> One of the most significant events for Folks Finance was the launch of its native <strong>FOLKS utility token</strong> on November 6<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="FOLKS Token Launch (November 2025): One of the most significant events for Folks Finance was the launch of its native FOLKS utility token on November 6," id="skTag-1986021259390574597" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021259390574597"></em>, 2025. The $FOLKS token is a standard Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) and serves as the governance and utility token for the platform<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The $FOLKS token is a standard Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) and serves as the governance and utility token for the platform." id="skTag-1986021731681787918" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731681787918"></em>. On the launch day, Folks Finance initiated a <strong>community airdrop</strong> campaign, distributing tokens to eligible users on its Binance Alpha platform<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="On the launch day,Folks Finance initiated a community airdrop campaign,distributing tokens to eligible users on its Binance Alpha platform." id="skTag-1986021263752650752" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650752"></em>. This airdrop was a means to reward and engage the community, encouraging users to participate in Folks Finance’s ecosystem activities. The token launch also coincided with the listing of <strong>$FOLKS on Binance</strong>, a major exchange, which added to the token’s visibility and liquidity<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The token launch also coincided with the listing of $FOLKS on Binance,a major exchange,which added to the token’s visibility and liquidity." id="skTag-1986021299465031680" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299465031680"></em>. As of launch, the total supply of FOLKS was 50 million tokens<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="As of launch,the total supply of FOLKS was 50 million tokens," id="skTag-1986021508088950811" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021508088950811"></em>, with 35% of the supply allocated to the community and 25.4% available in the initial circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Folks Mobile App (Pre-launch):</strong> In late 2025, Folks Finance announced the upcoming release of a <strong>mobile application</strong> – Folks Mobile – in partnership with a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). The Folks Mobile app will operate as a compliance-ready environment, bringing DeFi functionalities to users in a regulated manner. Key features of the mobile app include a <strong>debit card integration</strong>, allowing users to spend their crypto holdings without selling assets<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Key features of the mobile app include a debit card integration,allowing users to spend their crypto holdings without selling assets." id="skTag-1986021324815405070" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021324815405070"></em>. Instead of liquidating crypto, users can collateralize their assets in Folks Finance’s lending markets to borrow stablecoins, which can then be used to fund a Folks Debit Card. This integration enables users to spend money in the real world using their crypto collateral, effectively bridging traditional finance with DeFi<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Instead of liquidating crypto,users can collateralize their assets in Folks Finance’s lending markets to borrow stablecoins,which can then be used to fund a Folks Debit Card.

The waitlist for Folks Mobile opened on October 31<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The waitlist for Folks Mobile opened on October 31," id="skTag-1986021299471216650" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299471216650"></em>, 2025, giving early users priority access once the app launches. This development is a major step towards mass adoption, as it provides a familiar, regulated interface for DeFi services.</li>
<li><strong>Community Airdrop Campaign:</strong> Alongside the FOLKS token launch, Folks Finance ran a community airdrop on Binance Alpha<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Community Airdrop Campaign: Alongside the FOLKS token launch,Folks Finance ran a community airdrop on Binance Alpha." id="skTag-1986021263752650762" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650762"></em>. The airdrop campaign, which ran from November 6<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The airdrop campaign,which ran from November 6," id="skTag-1986021263752650755" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650755"></em>, 2025, to November 7, 2025, rewarded users who engaged with the platform. While specific airdrop rewards were not disclosed, past airdrops by Folks Finance and others (like <strong>Dino Tycoon</strong> and <strong>THORWallet</strong>) suggest that users could earn tokens by meeting certain criteria (such as a minimum number of transactions or balance threshold). The airdrop served as an incentive for users to interact with Folks Finance’s products and to onboard new users, thereby boosting community participation and platform usage.</li>
<li><strong>Binance Listing:</strong> The listing of FOLKS on Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, was a significant milestone<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Binance Listing: The listing of FOLKS on Binance,one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges,was a significant milestone." id="skTag-1986021263752650758" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650758"></em>.

<li><strong>Community Allocation (35%):</strong> A significant portion of the FOLKS supply (35%) is allocated to the community. This allocation is intended to reward and engage the community members who have supported Folks Finance’s growth. It includes airdrops, incentives, and rewards for users who participate in the platform’s ecosystem activities. For example, the recent Binance airdrop campaign was part of this community allocation, giving eligible users a share of the FOLKS tokens. The community allocation ensures that token holders include a broad range of users – from active lenders and borrowers to those who engage with the platform’s governance – thereby democratizing decision-making and aligning the interests of the community with the protocol’s success.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The community allocation ensures that token holders include a broad range of users – from active lenders and borrowers to those who engage with the platform’s governance – thereby democratizing decision-making and aligning the interests of the community with the protocol’s success." id="skTag-1986021508088950810" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021508088950810"></em></li>
<li><strong>Initial Circulation (25.4%):</strong> Approximately 25.4% of the total FOLKS supply was available for initial circulation at launch.

The inclusion of a substantial initial circulation is important for providing liquidity and enabling the token to be listed on exchanges like Binance, as mentioned earlier.

<li><strong>Team &amp; Advisors (20%):</strong> A 20% allocation is reserved for the Folks Finance team and advisors. This portion will be subject to vesting schedules to ensure that the team’s incentives are aligned with the long-term success of the project.

This allocation is crucial for retaining and incentivizing the core team, who have been instrumental in building Folks Finance. It also acknowledges the contributions of advisors and strategic partners who help guide the project.</li>
<li><strong>Reserve &amp; Incentives (19.6%):</strong> The remaining 19.6% of the FOLKS supply is designated for the reserve and future incentives. This portion will be used to fund ongoing incentives and rewards programs, as well as to support the development and expansion of the platform. It can also be used for marketing, community initiatives, and any other expenses needed to grow the ecosystem. Having a reserve ensures that the platform can continue to attract users and liquidity through incentives even as the initial funds are deployed. It also provides a buffer for future developments – for example, if the team decides to launch a new product or feature that requires additional funding, the reserve can be tapped to support it.</li>

The team’s 20% allocation, with vesting, helps maintain stability and long-term focus, while the community’s 35% allocation ensures that users have a stake in the platform’s governance and success.</p>
<p><strong>Token Utility:</strong> The FOLKS token serves multiple functions within the Folks Finance ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong> FOLKS token holders have the right to participate in the governance of Folks Finance<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Governance: FOLKS token holders have the right to participate in the governance of Folks Finance." id="skTag-1986021731681787918" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731681787918"></em>. This includes the ability to vote on proposals, such as changes to the protocol parameters (like interest rates, fees, or collateral factors), addition of new assets to the platform, and other strategic decisions. By holding FOLKS, users can influence the direction of the project<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="By holding FOLKS,users can influence the direction of the project." id="skTag-1986021731681787918" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731681787918"></em>. The governance model is designed to be decentralized, meaning that decisions are made by the community rather than a central authority. This aligns with the principles of Web3 and gives the community a voice in the platform’s development.</li>
<li><strong>Staking and Rewards:</strong> FOLKS tokens can be staked to earn rewards and additional benefits<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Staking and Rewards: FOLKS tokens can be staked to earn rewards and additional benefits." id="skTag-1986021259394768906" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021259394768906"></em>. Staking FOLKS is likely to be part of the platform’s incentive program, where users who stake their tokens receive a share of the protocol’s revenue or a portion of the token emissions<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Staking FOLKS is likely to be part of the platform’s incentive program,where users who stake their tokens receive a share of the protocol’s revenue or a portion of the token emissions." id="skTag-1986021299471216655" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299471216655"></em>. For example, users might be able to stake FOLKS to earn interest or to participate in a liquidity mining program, thereby increasing their yields on Folks Finance<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="For example,users might be able to stake FOLKS to earn interest or to participate in a liquidity mining program,thereby increasing their yields on Folks Finance." id="skTag-1986021299467022341" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299467022341"></em>. The exact mechanics of staking rewards are yet to be fully detailed, but it is expected that staking FOLKS will be a key way for users to engage with the token and earn passive income.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Fees and Discounts:</strong> FOLKS tokens could be used to pay fees on the platform or to access premium features. For instance, users might be able to use FOLKS to pay borrowing or lending fees, which could result in a fee discount or airdrop of FOLKS tokens<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="For instance,users might be able to use FOLKS to pay borrowing or lending fees,which could result in a fee discount or airdrop of FOLKS tokens." id="skTag-1986021508088950811" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021508088950811"></em>. Alternatively, FOLKS might be required to be held to use certain advanced features or to qualify for certain benefits (like higher borrowing limits or priority customer support). This utility ties the token more closely to the day-to-day use of the platform, encouraging users to hold FOLKS for practical reasons.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="This utility ties the token more closely to the day-to-day use of the platform,encouraging users to hold FOLKS for practical reasons." id="skTag-1986021299471216655" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299471216655"></em></li>
<li><strong>Liquidity and Trading:</strong> As a standard ASA, FOLKS can be traded on Algorand DEXes like Tinyman and on other platforms. This liquidity provision is important for the token’s price discovery and market stability<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Liquidity and Trading: As a standard ASA,FOLKS can be traded on Algorand DEXes like Tinyman and on other platforms.

The initial listing on Binance (a major exchange) will also contribute to FOLKS’s liquidity and trading volume<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The initial listing on Binance (a major exchange) will also contribute to FOLKS’s liquidity and trading volume." id="skTag-1986021263752650758" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021263752650758"></em>. Additionally, liquidity providers on DEXes might be incentivized to provide liquidity for FOLKS pairs using other tokens, possibly with FOLKS rewards.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Additionally,liquidity providers on DEXes might be incentivized to provide liquidity for FOLKS pairs using other tokens,possibly with FOLKS rewards." id="skTag-1986021324804939785" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021324804939785"></em></li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Utility:</strong> With Folks Finance expanding to multiple chains, FOLKS could potentially serve as a bridge or universal token across these chains<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Cross-Chain Utility: With Folks Finance expanding to multiple chains,FOLKS could potentially serve as a bridge or universal token across these chains." id="skTag-1986021392108818432" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021392108818432"></em>. For example, FOLKS might be used to facilitate cross-chain transactions or to represent ownership across different networks<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="For example,FOLKS might be used to facilitate cross-chain transactions or to represent ownership across different networks." id="skTag-1986021259394768897" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021259394768897"></em>. However, the specifics of cross-chain utility are still in development and will depend on how Folks Finance integrates FOLKS into its multi-chain strategy.<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="However,the specifics of cross-chain utility are still in development and will depend on how Folks Finance integrates FOLKS into its multi-chain strategy." id="skTag-1986021299465031680" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021299465031680"></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance Mechanism:</strong> Folks Finance’s governance mechanism is built around the FOLKS token, allowing token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="Governance Mechanism: Folks Finance’s governance mechanism is built around the FOLKS token,allowing token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol." id="skTag-1986021392108818432" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021392108818432"></em>. The governance process is expected to be similar to other DeFi projects: users can submit proposals via the platform or through a governance portal, and FOLKS holders vote on these proposals<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The governance process is expected to be similar to other DeFi projects: users can submit proposals via the platform or through a governance portal,and FOLKS holders vote on these proposals." id="skTag-1986021731681787912" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731681787912"></em>. Quorum and voting thresholds will determine if a proposal passes. The platform’s governance contract will tally votes and execute the approved changes<em data-skywork="text_badge" data-sk-source-type="web_search" data-sk-source-text="The platform’s governance contract will tally votes and execute the approved changes." id="skTag-1986021731862650891" class="sk-source-tag" data-sk-source-id="1986021731862650891"></em>. This decentralized governance ensures that the community can drive improvements and adapt the platform to new needs. It also aligns with the project’s community-driven ethos.</p>
<p>In summary, the FOLKS token is the cornerstone of Folks Finance’s ecosystem, providing governance rights, utility within the platform, and incentives for community participation. The thoughtful tokenomics distribution ensures that no single group holds an overly dominant share of the tokens, which helps in maintaining a decentralized and fair ecosystem. With FOLKS in place, Folks Finance can continue to incentivize user growth, innovation, and active community involvement, which are essential for the long-term success of the project.</p>
<h2 id="section-security-and-audits">Security and Audits</h2>
